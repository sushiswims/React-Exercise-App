# PROCESS – Search Bar Feature

## What I Built
For this assignment, I added a search bar to assignment I made for another class, which was a React app. The search bar allows you to filter exercises by name as they type. When the input is empty, all exercises are displayed. The filtering updates in real time, which makes it easier to quickly find a specific exercise.

## Micro-Iteration Experience
Working in small steps felt easier than writing one big prompt. At first it seemed slower, but it actually made debugging easier because I could test each change before moving on. Breaking the feature into small pieces helped me understand what each part of the code was doing instead of just copying a large block all at once.

## Self-Review – What It Caught
When I asked Claude to review its own code, it pointed out that I wasn’t handling the case where the search input was empty. That would have caused the list to stay filtered instead of showing all exercises again. It also mentioned making the filter case-insensitive, which helped the usability. The self-review step helped catch small logic issues before they became bigger problems.

## Tool Impressions (Claude Web)
Using Claude in the browser was simple and easy to manage. I liked that I could focus on one step at a time without being overwhelmed. However, I still had to carefully check file names and structure to make sure it matched my project. Overall, it was helpful for structured development.
